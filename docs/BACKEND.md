# Backend conventions

This document defines the backend architecture, security model, and data strategy for Itsyship. All server-side code must follow these conventions.

## Architecture

Single-process Next.js application. SQLite database via `better-sqlite3` + Drizzle ORM. No external services required.

```
Next.js process
├── /app/api/*        → Route handlers (REST)
├── /lib/asc/*        → App Store Connect SDK wrapper
├── /lib/ai/*         → Vercel AI SDK integration
├── /lib/db/*         → Drizzle schema, queries, migrations
├── /lib/sync/*       → Background data sync worker
└── /data/itsyship.db → SQLite (Docker volume mount)
```

## Database

**SQLite with WAL mode.** Pragmas set at connection time:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
```

SQLite is the right choice for this workload. Max scale is 30-50 users, 20-30 apps, thousands of versions/builds. SQLite handles millions of rows. Reads are fast (served from memory after first access), writes are infrequent (config changes, cache refreshes). Single file means simple Docker volume mount and trivial backups. Same DB engine works for a future Electron desktop app.

### Schema

All tables use Drizzle ORM. Timestamps are ISO 8601 strings. IDs are ULIDs (sortable, no coordination needed for future multi-user).

**Core tables:**

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | id, name, email, passwordHash, role (admin/member), createdAt |
| `ascCredentials` | id, issuerId, keyId, encryptedPrivateKey, isActive, createdAt |
| `aiSettings` | id, provider, modelId, encryptedApiKey, updatedAt |

**Cache tables** (one per ASC resource type):

| Table | Purpose | TTL |
|---|---|---|
| `cacheApps` | App list + metadata | 1h |
| `cacheVersions` | App Store versions per app | 15min |
| `cacheBuilds` | TestFlight builds per app | 5min |
| `cacheReviews` | Customer reviews per app | 15min |
| `cacheAnalytics` | Analytics snapshots | 1h |
| `cacheSales` | Sales/financial data | 1h |

Every cache table has `fetchedAt` (timestamp of last sync) and `data` (JSON blob). Queries check `fetchedAt` against TTL to determine staleness.

## Data fetching strategy

**Cache-first with background revalidation.** Never block page loads on ASC API calls.

1. **Page loads always serve from cache** – instant render, no spinners
2. **Background sync** runs on a timer per resource type (see TTLs above)
3. **Manual refresh button** forces immediate fetch for that resource
4. **Staleness indicator** – "updated X min ago" so users know data freshness
5. **Write-through** – when a user saves metadata, write to ASC then update cache immediately

Background sync runs in-process via `setInterval`. No Redis, no BullMQ, no cron. If the process restarts, it does a fresh sync on startup.

Sync worker deduplicates: if a fetch for a resource is already in-flight, new requests wait for the existing one rather than making duplicate API calls.

## Security

### Authentication

- **iron-session** encrypted cookies. HttpOnly, Secure (in production), SameSite=Lax.
- Password hashing with **argon2** (preferred) or bcrypt.
- Session contains `userId` and `role`. 7-day expiry.
- Admin user created via the onboarding wizard on first run (name, email, password).
- Future: multi-user with invite flow, but schema supports it from day one.

### CSRF protection

- All mutation routes (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) validate the `Origin` header matches the app's origin.
- SameSite=Lax cookies prevent cross-site request forgery for top-level navigations.
- No custom CSRF tokens needed – Origin validation + SameSite cookies is sufficient for same-origin API routes.

### Rate limiting

Two levels:

1. **Internal rate limiting** – protect our own API routes:
   - Auth endpoints: 5 attempts per minute per IP (brute force protection)
   - All other routes: 60 requests per minute per user
   - Implementation: in-memory sliding window counter (no Redis needed at this scale)
   - Returns `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header

2. **ASC API rate limiting** – respect Apple's limits:
   - Token bucket: 5 requests/second sustained
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff on 429
   - Never exceed Apple's rate limits – queue requests if needed

### Input validation

- **Zod schemas** for every API route input. Validate before any processing.
- Parse, don't validate – use Zod's `.parse()` to get typed output.
- File uploads: validate type, size (max 10 MB for .p8 files), content structure.
- All database queries use Drizzle ORM parameterised queries – no raw SQL string concatenation.
- Sanitise user-visible strings (names, descriptions) – trim whitespace, normalise unicode.

### Encryption at rest

- ASC private keys and AI API keys encrypted with **AES-256-GCM envelope encryption**.
- Master key from `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` env var (32 bytes, hex-encoded).
- Unique data encryption key (DEK) per secret. DEK encrypted by master key.
- Decryption happens server-side only, on-demand, never cached in memory longer than needed.

### HTTP security headers

Set via Next.js middleware or `next.config.ts`:

- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`

### Environment variables

Validated at startup with Zod. App refuses to start if required vars are missing or malformed.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_EMAIL` | No | Pre-seed admin email (skips onboarding step) |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | No | Pre-seed admin password (skips onboarding step) |
| `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` | Yes | 32-byte hex key for envelope encryption |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | 32+ char secret for iron-session |
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default 3000) |

## API conventions

- All routes under `/app/api/`.
- JSON request/response. Content-Type validation on mutations.
- Consistent error format: `{ error: string, details?: unknown }`.
- HTTP status codes: 200 (ok), 201 (created), 400 (bad input), 401 (not authenticated), 403 (not authorised), 404 (not found), 429 (rate limited), 500 (server error).
- Every route handler: validate session → validate input (Zod) → business logic → response.
- No business logic in route handlers – delegate to service functions in `/lib/`.

## Testing

- **Vitest** for unit and integration tests.
- **Playwright** for E2E (critical user flows).
- **MSW** (Mock Service Worker) for mocking ASC API responses in tests.
- Test database uses in-memory SQLite (`:memory:`).
- 100% coverage target for business logic. UI components tested via E2E.
- Every API route has at least: happy path, validation error, auth error tests.

## ASC API wrapper

Thin wrapper around `appstore-connect-sdk`:

- Auto-generates JWT from encrypted credentials (decrypt on demand, 15 min token lifetime).
- Request queue with rate limiting (token bucket).
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (max 3 retries).
- Response caching (write to SQLite cache tables).
- Typed responses using the SDK's generated types.

## AI integration

Uses **Vercel AI SDK** with provider packages (`@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/openai`, etc.):

- Provider and model configurable in settings (stored in `aiSettings` table).
- API key encrypted at rest, decrypted on-demand for requests.
- All AI features are optional – hidden from UI if no API key is configured.
- Streaming responses for copywriting/translation.
- Structured output with Zod schemas for translations (ensures correct locale keys, field lengths).
- Token usage tracked and displayed to users.
